## Project Overview

This project focuses on **eye tracking** using machine learning techniques, leveraging pre-trained models to predict gaze direction from image data.  
The goal is to improve the accessibility and accuracy of gaze tracking in various applications, including assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

## Environment Setup

We use **Conda** to manage the development environment.  
To create the environment, run:

```bash
$ conda create -n pfe python=3.12
$ conda activate pfe
```

To install all dependencies:

```bash
$ make lib
```

## Installation & Dependencies

Install project dependencies:

```bash
$ make lib
```

## Model

We use the pre-trained **GazeCapture** model for eye tracking, based on deep learning techniques.  
The original model was developed by MIT CSAIL and is presented in the paper:  

> **Eye Tracking for Everyone**  
> Krafka et al. (2016)  
> [ðŸ“„ Read on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05814)

The model is available at: [GazeCapture GitHub](https://github.com/CSAILVision/GazeCapture).

## Documentation

We use **Sphinx** to generate project documentation.  
To build the documentation:

```bash
$ make doc
```

The generated HTML files will be available in the `docs/_build/html/` directory.

## Testing

To run unit tests:

```bash
$ make test
```
